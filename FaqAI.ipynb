        "## Scenario Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine an e-commerce website that has an extensive FAQ page. This FAQ page is designed to help users by answering common questions about products, shipping, returns, payment methods, and more. However, users often prefer to get their answers directly through an interactive chat system rather than manually searching through the FAQ page.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The goal is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can directly interact with users and provide them with accurate and relevant answers by leveraging the existing FAQ data. This means that instead of having the user navigate through the FAQ page, the system will automatically retrieve the most relevant information from the FAQ dataset and present it in a conversational format.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "- **FAQ Dataset**: We have a dataset consisting of JSON objects, each containing a frequently asked question (FAQ) and its corresponding answer. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is specifically designed for e-commerce-related queries: [Ecommerce-FAQ-Chatbot-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadmakhdoom/ecommerce-faq-chatbot-dataset)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **User Interaction**: A user asks a question through the chat interface. Instead of redirecting the user to the FAQ page, the system will process the question in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Retrieval Mechanism**: The system will search through the FAQ dataset to find the most relevant question-answer pair(s) that match the user's query.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Answer Generation**: Once the relevant information is retrieved, the system will generate a response that is directly presented to the user in a conversational manner. The response may be the exact answer from the dataset or a synthesized answer that is tailored to the user's query."
